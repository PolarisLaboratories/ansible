# ansible
Files for configuring Polaris servers using Ansible.

The scripts are oriented towards deploying a server, although they can also be used to manage existing servers.

# Usage
Before starting, make sure the servers are in the hosts file.

Now, to run the standard deployment script, simply execute `ansible-playbook provisioning.yml`.
